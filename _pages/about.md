I am a Master's student in [Management Science and Engineering](https://msande.stanford.edu) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu), where I work with [Professor Xiaojie Qiu](https://qiulab.stanford.edu/) in the Department of Genetics and Computer Science. My research focuses on developing computational frameworks for **predictive modeling of embryonic development** through the integration of spatial transcriptomics, single-cell genomics, and machine learning.

Prior to Stanford, I earned my B.S. in [Applied Mathematics](https://math.duke.edu/applied-math-analysis-events) with Scholarship Award (top 5%) from [Duke University](https://duke.edu) and [Duke Kunshan University](https://www.dukekunshan.edu.cn), where I developed a strong foundation in dynamical systems, stochastic modeling, and numerical analysis.

My long-term vision is to build a **Virtual Embryo**‚Äîa computational system capable of simulating developmental trajectories with biological fidelity to illuminate mechanisms of congenital disease and enable preventive interventions before birth.

## Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of **machine learning**, **computational biology**, and **developmental genomics**:

- **Computational Developmental Biology**: Predictive modeling of cell fate decisions, spatiotemporal gene regulation, and morphogenesis using neural fields, graph neural networks, and flow matching
- **Spatial Transcriptomics & Single-Cell Genomics**: 3D embryo reconstruction, RNA velocity vector field analysis, and multi-scale integration of genomic and imaging data
- **Machine Learning Theory & Applications**: Generative models for biological systems, neural ODEs, transformers for sequence modeling, and reinforcement learning for dynamic systems

## Current Research

I am currently working on several projects in the [Qiu Lab](https://qiulab.stanford.edu/):

**Virtual Embryo Framework** ‚Äî Leading the conceptual design and manuscript preparation for a Nature Comment proposing a multi-scale, cross-modal framework for predictive embryo modeling using hierarchical graph neural networks, flow matching, and transformers.

**Neural Field for 3D Embryo Reconstruction** ‚Äî Contributing to the development of a differentiable framework for reconstructing 3D embryonic structures from 2D spatial transcriptomic slices, with enhanced Transformer-based positional encodings and improved training stability.

**Dynamo: RNA Velocity & Vector Field Analysis** ‚Äî Co-authoring a Nature Protocols manuscript on predictive modeling of single-cell transcriptomic dynamics, including differential geometry analyses and in silico perturbation predictions.
