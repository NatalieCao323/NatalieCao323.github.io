## Abstract

This perspective proposes a comprehensive framework for building a **Virtual Embryo**â€”a computational system capable of simulating developmental trajectories with biological fidelity. By integrating spatial transcriptomics, single-cell genomics, and advanced machine learning architectures including hierarchical graph neural networks, flow matching, and transformers, we outline a path toward predictive developmental modeling that can illuminate mechanisms of congenital disease and enable preventive interventions before birth.

## Key Contributions

- Conceptual framework for multi-scale, cross-modal integration of genomic and imaging data
- Proposed architecture combining graph neural networks for spatial relationships, flow matching for temporal dynamics, and transformers for sequence modeling
- Discussion of theoretical challenges in predictive developmental modeling
- Vision for in silico embryology as a tool for understanding and preventing congenital disorders

## Status

Manuscript under review at *Nature Methods*.
